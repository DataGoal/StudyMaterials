AMAZON EMR:
Amazon EMR (previously called Amazon Elastic MapReduce) is a managed cluster platform that simplifies running big data frameworks, such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark, on AWS to process and analyze vast amounts of data. Using these frameworks and related open-source projects, you can process data for analytics purposes and business intelligence workloads. Amazon EMR also lets you transform and move large amounts of data into and out of other AWS data stores and databases, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon DynamoDB.

Overview of Amazon EMR:
Understanding clusters and nodes

The central component of Amazon EMR is the cluster. A cluster is a collection of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. Each instance in the cluster is called a node. Each node has a role within the cluster, referred to as the node type. Amazon EMR also installs different software components on each node type, giving each node a role in a distributed application like Apache Hadoop.

The node types in Amazon EMR are as follows:

Primary node: A node that manages the cluster by running software components to coordinate the distribution of data and tasks among other nodes for processing. The primary node tracks the status of tasks and monitors the health of the cluster. Every cluster has a primary node, and it's possible to create a single-node cluster with only the primary node.
Core node: A node with software components that run tasks and store data in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) on your cluster. Multi-node clusters have at least one core node.
Task node: A node with software components that only runs tasks and does not store data in HDFS. Task nodes are optional.
